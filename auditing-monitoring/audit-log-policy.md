# Audit and Accountability Policy (NIST AU-2)
**Objective:** To create a "Digital Paper Trail" of all critical actions within Milot Motors.

## 1. Events to be Audited
Milot Motors will log the following events:
- **Login/Logout:** Every time a mechanic or admin enters the system.
- **Privilege Changes:** If a user is promoted to "Admin."
- **Data Access:** Every time customer PII (VINs, Names) is viewed or exported.
- **System Changes:** Software updates or security setting modifications.

## 2. Log Retention
- All logs must be stored for **1 year** to satisfy regulatory audits.
- Logs must be "Immutable" (cannot be changed or deleted by the person who created them).
