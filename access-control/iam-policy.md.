# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policy
**Objective:** To ensure only authorized personnel have access to Milot Motors' digital assets.

- **Mechanics:** Access to service records only.
- **Admissions/Office:** Access to billing and client PII only.
- **Owner (You):** Full administrative access.

## 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- MFA is **mandatory** for all cloud accounts (GitHub, Email, Service Software).
- Hardware keys (e.g., Yubikey) are preferred over SMS codes.

## 3. Account Lifecycle
- **Onboarding:** Identity verification (Gov-issued ID) required before account creation.
- **Offboarding:** Access is revoked within 1 hour of employee termination.
