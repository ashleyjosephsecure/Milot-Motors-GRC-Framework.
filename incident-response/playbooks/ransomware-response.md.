# Playbook: Ransomware Response (NIST-Aligned)
**Scenario:** Systems are encrypted, a ransom note is displayed, or unusual mass file-renaming is detected.

## 1. Detection & Analysis
- **Identify the Strain:** Capture a screenshot of the ransom note and use tools (e.g., ID Ransomware) to identify the variant.
- **Scope Assessment:** Determine which network segments and backups are affected.
- **Check for Exfiltration:** Look for signs that data was stolen (Double Extortion) before encryption.

## 2. Containment (Immediate Action)
- **Isolate Systems:** Unplug ethernet cables or disable Wi-Fi on infected machines immediately.
- **Network Kill Switch:** If widespread, take the shop network offline at the switch level.
- **Do NOT Power Down:** Leave infected machines on (but isolated) to preserve volatile memory for forensics.

## 3. Eradication & Recovery
- **Backup Verification:** Check the integrity of "Air-Gapped" or Offline backups.
- **System Rebuild:** Wipe infected drives and reinstall OS from clean images.
- **Password Reset:** Force a global password reset for all users and service accounts.

## 4. Post-Incident
- **Root Cause Analysis:** How did they get in? (Phishing, RDP, Unpatched software?)
- **The "No-Pay" Policy:** Milot Motors does not pay ransoms; we rely on immutable backups.
